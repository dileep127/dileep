<h1> what is wamp?</h1>
<p>WAMP is an acronym that stands for Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It’s a software stack which means installing WAMP installs Apache, MySQL , and PHP on your operating system (Windows in the case of WAMP). Even though you can install them separately, they are usually bundled up, and for a good reason too.
What’s good to know is that WAMP derives from  LAMP (the L stands for Linux). The only difference between these two is that WAMP is used for Windows, while LAMP – for Linux based operating systems.

“W” stands for Windows, there’s also LAMP (for Linux) and MAMP (for Mac).
“A” stands for Apache. Apache is the server software that is responsible for serving web pages. When you request a page to be seen by you, Apache grants your request over HTTP and shows you the site.
“M” stands for MySQL. MySQL’s job is to be the database management system for your server. It stores all of the relevant information like your site’s content, user profiles, etc.
“P” stands for PHP. It’s the programming language that was used to write WordPress. It acts like glue for this whole software stack. PHP is running in conjunction with Apache and communicating with MySQL.

<h1>advantages of wamp server</h1>
<p>Wamp server is a collection of programs you can use to turn your regular desktop PC to a fully compatible web server with HTTP, PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, SQLBuddy applications. The advantage is that it is easy configurable with the built-in tools. Also it is structured in the way that you have everything you need at a click distance. The configuration screens provide extra information how settings should look like. Another thing would be that the packed applications are configured to be compatible between them, all being automatic configured, you just unpack your script, database, application, run the installer (if it has any) and that's it.
